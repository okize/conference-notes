## Accessibility in the browser

### Cassidy Williams

__Summary:__
Static, page-based sites are everyday being replaced by dynamic web applications that make heavy use of JavaScript and AJAX. Widgets and controls can now be built entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Many users are at risk of being excluded from the growing responsiveness and usability of the web due to increasing accessibility gaps. There are now ways, with JavaScript (which is often thought of as quite inaccessible to those who use assistive technologies), to make dynamic web interfaces that are accessible to many kinds of users. In this talk, we'll discuss the Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification (ARIA), which enables dynamic, JavaScript-driven applications to work with a variety of desktop-based assistive technologies. By the end of this talk, the audience will understand the importance of the ARIA specification, and how easy it is to incorporate it in their own applications.
