## A smarter, more unified web

### Marek Olszewski

__Summary:__
This talk will cover two trends that we've been noticing in recent years, namely that the web is getting smarter and also that it's getting less fragmented and more unified. Recent advances in machine learning have made artificial intelligence radically more sophisticated in the past few years. When combined with scalable crowd working, it's now easier than ever to build web applications with more smarts, enabling simpler and more delightful user interfaces and ultimately happier customers. Consequently, there's a growing demand for fullstack engineers that have a solid background in machine learning. If you don't have that background, now is the time to learn. Secondly, the web is also getting more unified. Google's ability to execute and index websites with Javascript loaded content have made client-side widget-based website mashups significantly more interesting. When coupled with more and more open APIs and data sets, the web is becoming more connected and as a result, more cohesive.

#### Smarter web apps
Does more than heavy-lifting for it's users behind the scenes. Machine learning. - Google Now

recent advances in machine learning; 2000-2009, machine learning advancements were flat. 

deep learning - "reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks" was the catalyst.

instead of :

train to classify

do:

1) train to generate

2) train to classify using fewer labeled inputs

accessibility is achieved by

* better tools
* easier to get labeled data
	* cheaper
	* easier to get going

**[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)**

machine-learning will be expected of any full-stack developer in the future

#### Unification of the web

client-side integrations

* google indexes Javascript content
* browsers finally have good support for CORS

#### how to get js indexed by google?

* no async loading (Google will not execute)
* Keep JS file small (100kb was upper limit)
* Avoid relying on large frameworks (raw JS ftw)
