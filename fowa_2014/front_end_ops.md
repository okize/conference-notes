## Front-End Ops

### Alex Sexton

__Summary:__
Alex coined the term "Front-End Ops" in his Smashing Mag article last year and the community around it has been growing steadily since. Front-End Ops refers to all the work outside of the core of a front-end app. It is performance monitoring and bug tracking; it's build tools and error tracking; and it's developer happiness and maintainability. All these ideas make for quite a bit of work outside of the core application development. This talk will go over techniques to integrate these smoothly into your projects, and help you benefit from having a solid foundation to hold up your apps.
