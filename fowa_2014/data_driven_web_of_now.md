## The data driven web of now: extending DS3.js

### Travis Smith

__Summary:__
Data on the Web can be represented in a number of ways and is often represented in more than one way at once. Maintaining entire libraries of templates to support growing applications is become harder and harder as a result. In addition, the requirement that data be live is hampered by existing methodologies. We will work through using and extending D3js to expressively generate representations of data that can be updated live.
