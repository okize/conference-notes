## Quit complaining and just write the code!

### Dustin Diaz

__Summary:__
The future of the web is not going to write itself. Ditch your scrum master, stop debating the definition of "agile", throw away your OKr's, and cancel your next team offsite. Instead pick a direction and communicate with everyone on your team about what you're doing, hang out with your team during lunch and happy hours, and whatever you think agile is (or new form thereof) — demonstrate it with action and results will happen! Whether it's Node or Rails, Ember or Angular, LESS or SASS — Stop complaining and write the code that moves you forward in the way you know best.
