## Web legos: an intro to web components with Polymer

### Rob Dodson

__Summary:__
Building modern websites and apps is getting more complex with new technologies, stacks and tools introduced daily. Wouldn't it be great if we could simplify things a bit? Web Components aim to solve some of these complexities by providing a unified way to create new elements that encompass rich functionality without the need for all the extra libraries. In this talk, Rob will discuss where we're at with Web Components and how you can use the Polymer framework to build custom components today. This session will be followed by a more in-depth session at 3:25pm.
