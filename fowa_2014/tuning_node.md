## Tuning Node

### Joe McCann

__Summary:__
Ever wondered how to write performant Node apps? What about how V8 optimizes the JavaScript you write in your Node.js application? Should you use the cluster module for load balancing? As Node grows in popularity and its use cases expand from simple chat applications, best practices and patterns for writing performant applications have started to surface but haven't been widely adopted. At NodeSource, we work with loads of clients whom have varying challenges when it comes to performance, scale and productivity. Joe will share some of the findings and talk a bit more about the future of Node.js application development.
