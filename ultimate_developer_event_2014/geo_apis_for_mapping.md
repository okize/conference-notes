## Geo apis for mapping and more

### Raj Singh

__Summary:__
In this session we'll walk through all the basic steps of building geo-enabled apps, from capturing a device's location, to storing that data in a cloud database-as-a-service, to mapping and visualization on the other end. We'll learn the HTML5 Geolocation API, which gives web developers an API for accessing the GPS (or other positioning hardware) of a device. Then we'll use the Cloudant database-as-a-service for cloud storage and play around with some geo-enabled search APIs used by Cloudant, Yelp, Facebook and others. Finally, we'll put our data on a map and see how data accessed from various APIs can come together in a single map interface.
