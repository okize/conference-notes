## API driven development with node.js

### Joe McCann

__Summary:__
Good API’s receive developer adoption, poor API’s receive developer rage. Whether the API is consumed by the public developer community, internally to by your company, used only in a single engineering team, or just for you- a well documented, thought though, intuitive API is will lead to developer joy. Happy developers are more productive with their time and able to realize an API’s intended core value which will allow them to concentrate building their own product faster. Integrating a culture around great API’s needs to be embedded into the development process. We will explore what it means to tackle a new project with by designing the API’s first, discussing the costs and benefits to this approach. Looking at successful API patterns and emerging paradigms can help while doing API first development, so we will systematically study several mainstream Node.js API’s that has lead to a fast adoption. Maintaining API’s is not a trivial matter where some projects do it much better than others. Let’s examine best practices around how to maintain a well used API and keep a balance between forward innovation and robustness.

---

#### Good APIs get adopted

* can measure quality of API by adoption

#### Bad APIs

* low adoption
* unpleasant experience for developers
* API not following spec

#### APIs in Node

* node_modules
* HTTP REST APIs
* Async APIs

#### Traits of Good APIs

* keep it simple
* keep it small
* keep it consistent
* make it fun

##### Simple

you have 30 seconds for a developer...

* ...to figure out the module's value
* ...to understand how to use is
* ...to make a good impression

###### Small

* "do one thing and do it well"
* limit the surface of your api
* abstract the complexities behind a small API

###### Consistent

only having to learn one set of conventions makes adopting your API that much easier on developers

##### Fun

provide developers the fastest route to success and allow them to see results immediately
