## Designing irresistible APIs

### Kirsten Hunter

__Summary:__
When creating a new REST platform, the planning process frequently gets skipped (or is misunderstood) resulting in an ill-conceived API. I'll walk you through the steps needed to create an API that developers love, and point out the common traps to avoid. The presentation will cover creating user stories, deciding on metrics, planning the API, design decisions, documentation and developer support. I will focus on teaching you how to create a developer experience that will delight and amaze your developer partners and increase engagement with your platform. This talk will focus on higher level choices rather than HTTP architecture, and is appropriate for developers, product managers, or anyone else with an interest in achieving success for their API program. The Open API Ecosystem is an amazing opportunity for companies to partner with developers, but you really only get one chance to impress, so come learn how to make your company's API an "A List" destination. What should the audience expect to learn from your talk?: *API Developer Experience *API Use Cases *Measuring Success
