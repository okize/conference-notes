## Scale oriented architecture with APIs

### John Sheehan

__Summary:__
Modern apps are distributed, powered by a network of loosely-connected services that span every part of an organization. But APIs can be leveraged for more than just technical reasons, helping us scale our teams as much as our infrastructure. Learn about strategies for building a scale-oriented architecture applicable for teams of 2 to 200.

Runscope: Log - Monitor - Measure Your API

today: 40+ internal services & only 7 engineers

__micro services:__

* independent deployability
* independent scalability
* network resiliency
* network mindset
* isolate breakage
* human modularity
* uniform interface

if you don't invest in infrastructure - don't invest in microservices

challenges for running an API-driven application

1. getting a complete picture of your app
2. managing change (avoid using SDKs in your API)
3. testing & monitoring
