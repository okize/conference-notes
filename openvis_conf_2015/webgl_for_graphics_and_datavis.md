## Webgl for graphics and data visualization

### Nicolas Garcia Belmonte

__Summary:__
Unlike other web standards for graphics, WebGL lets you process and render millions of elements in a web application in real time. WebGLâ€™s strongest feature is the control it gives the user to offload computations to the GPU. In this talk Nicolas will give an introduction to WebGL & GLSL by explaining how WebGL works behind the scenes (the rendering pipeline), and will give examples of how WebGL fits the data visualization process not only for real-time exploration of massive datasets, but also for physics simulations and data art/illustration.
