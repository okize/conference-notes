## Building earth: an animated map of global weather

### Cameron Beccario

__Summary:__
Earth is a cheap to run, fast to use, interactive visualization of public domain weather data. Initially started as a fun project to learn JavaScript, Earth quickly evolved into an effort to make weather visualizations accessible, beautiful, and scalable. Launched with a tweet in December 2013, the site received 1.5 million unique users in its first month at an operational cost of $11. In this talk, Cameron will discuss the technology behind Earth, the sourcing and processing of the data, and its reception in communities around the world.

#### lessons learned

* UX: nobody could find the menu; anything that could be done to fix this would destroy the asthetic
* streamlines vs pathlines; people couldn't tell what they were looking at
* free stuff; geo data, weather data, frameworks, bandwidth, help
