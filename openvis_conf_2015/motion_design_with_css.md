#### animation principles

##### 1. timing

* appearing to obey the laws of "physics"
* establishes mood, emotion and reactions
* timing function keywords: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, cubic-bezier

##### 2. follow through

* subjects that appear to move past their destination point (because they have so much energy they overshoot)

##### 3. secondary action

* any supplemental action that reinforces and adds dimension
