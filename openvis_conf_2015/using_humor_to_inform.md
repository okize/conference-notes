## Using humor to inform

### Nigel Holmes

__Summary:__
Nigel has always believed that if you can get readers to smile, you are more than halfway to getting them to read on, and stay with a given subject, even though it may be a complex subject they know nothing about (and may not even be that interested in). In this talk, Nigel will show some work that misses and hits the mark: where gentle use of humor humanizes the data, or makes it relevant to the reader/user.
