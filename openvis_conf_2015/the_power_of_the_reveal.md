### The power of the reveal

### Hannah Fairfield

__Summary:__
We spend our days acquiring data and desperately trying to find clarity in it. We build stuff that looks terrible. Or fails completely. Or makes the data even more opaque and confusing than it first appeared. But the reason we do it is for the moon shot: the certainty that if we keep at it, we begin to see some signals, some new patterns in the visual analysis. We try another metric, run another version, start over on the visualization. And if we are determined, and lucky, and have very good editors — we can use visualization to reveal the data’s most important and essential themes. In this talk, Hannah will discuss the strength of the reveal.
