## That's the power of loops
### & why repetition is a curious thing

### Lena Groeger

__Summary:__
Animated gifs. Vines. Looping interactive graphics - There have never been so many ways to use endless, repeating sequences to present ideas, explain processes, and just capture moments in time. Loops to demonstrate chance and probability. Loops to expose the inner workings of an elaborate piece of machinery. Loops that follow stages and life cycles and transformations. Why do loops work so well as explanatory tools? Where are they used most effectively â€“ and where do they fail? And most of all, why are they so addictive? In this talk, Lena will explore the science and design behind our obsession with everything loops.
