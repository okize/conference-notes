## What is the role of visualization in prediction?

### Adam Perer

__Summary:__
Many visualization practitioners tend to focus on developing techniques and systems to support the analysis of datasets. However, there are a growing number of data scientists and consumers interested in more than just interpreting their data: they want to understand their data and the predictive probabilities associated with them. Providing visual support for this kind of task has become important as many existing applications and stories on the market and in scientific settings need to solve problems that are predictive in nature, e.g., prediction of customer behavior, diseases, and drug effectiveness. In this talk, Adam will describe a typical predictive modeling pipeline, and describe how informative visualizations can assist in all steps of the pipeline and result in more comprehensible predictive models.
