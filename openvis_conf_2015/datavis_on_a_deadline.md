## Data visualization on a deadline

### Alyson Hurt

__Summary:__
Over time the NPR Visuals Team developed a workflow and a set of tools to help build quick-turnaround, small-scale graphics (such as charts, data tables, interactive visualizations). In this talk, Alyson will discuss some of their tools, like using Google Spreadsheets as a mini-CMS, creating templates for frequently-reused code, designing responsively, and working with (and around) ones' CMS.
