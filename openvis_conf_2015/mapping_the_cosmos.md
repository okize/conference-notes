## Mapping the cosmos: visualizing millions of objects in space

### Ian Webster

__Summary:__
New browser technologies are changing the way big industries handle their data. Using the space industry as an example, we’ll investigate some of the unique data and visualization challenges encountered while building Asterank, a space analytics platform used by commercial space companies, government, and research organizations. Asterank enables immersive, scientifically accurate visualizations of known objects in space and basic mission analysis. This talk will describe how its frontend pushed the limits of webGL, web workers, and other new tech in order to creatively inform in a beautiful and meaningful way. We’ll also see how an open community of scientists and developers used visualization to make a lasting impact in other areas they’re passionate about.
