#### Visualization tools

#### How might we create visualizations?

* spreadsheet; easy to use but lacks expressiveness
* programming low-level
* programming framework-level

* chart typologies (excel)
* visual analysis grammars (ggplot2)
* visualization grammars (protovis, d3.js)
* component architectures (prefuse, flae)
* graphics APIs (processing, opengl)

#### What is declarative language?

* programming by describing what, not how
* separate specification *what you want) from execution (how it should be computed)
* in contrast to imperative programming where you muc give explicit steps

#### Why delcarative?

* Faster iteration. Less code. Larger use base.
* Better visualization. Smart defaults.
* Reuse. Write-once, then re-apply.
* Performance. Optimization, scalability.
* Portability. Multiple devices, renderers, inputs.
* Programmatic generation. Write programs which output visualizations.

#### Visualization grammar

* Data
* Transforms
* Scales
* Guides
* Marks
