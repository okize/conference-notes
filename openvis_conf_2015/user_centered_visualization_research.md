## User-centered visualization research

### Lane Harrison

__Summary:__
Decades of research and practice has yielded a wealth of techniques and technologies for visualizing data. Yet we currently lack a theory by which we can navigate this growing design space. Questions like "which chart is best for representing correlation?" or "when should I bin a scatterplot?" sound simple enough, but answering them requires us to advance the science of visualization. In this talk, Lane will highlight fundamental design choices for which we have little guidance, and share how visualization research is leveraging the strengths and limitations of our perceptual and cognitive abilities to answer them.
