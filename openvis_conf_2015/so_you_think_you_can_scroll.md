## So you think you can scroll

### Jim Vallandingham

__Summary:__
Scrolling is a fundamental part of the web experience. But scrolling within web browsers has been optimized for continuous homogeneous content, like text. Can scrolling be utilized to provide intuitive and seamless interactions in complex multimedia interactive visualizations? If so, how might we implement these using open web technologies? In this session, Jim will discuss the use of scrolling in data visualization and interactive storytelling, show numerous examples and dissect their implementation, compare scrolling to other techniques and explore how it applies to data visualization on the mobile web.
