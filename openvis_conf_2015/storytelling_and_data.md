## Storytelling and data: why? how? when?

### Robert Kosara

__Summary:__
What good is all that analytical data visualization if we're unable to communicate our insights and findings to decision-makers? What do we do all this work for if not to present our results, and present them well? Humans have told stories for many thousands of years, and there are elements of storytelling that can be used for more effective and interesting data presentations. Don't be put off by the current hype around the term, there are real, useful lessons to be learned. In this talk, Robert will give an overview of what storytelling means in the context of data, talk about research in this space and offer some practical advice. Robert will guide us through examples from news media, relevant bits of classic storytelling, comic theory and results from neuroscience that show how our brain responds to well-presented stories.
