## Blindfolded cartography

### Andy Woodruff

__Summary:__
Principles of cartographic design teach us to make careful decisions based on the particular data being mapped: choosing the right map projection, symbolization technique, classification, and colors, to name a few. Web cartography introduces a new challenge - designing interactive maps that can handle unknown data. From exploratory tools to maps that enable users to bring their own data, when a cartographer is flying blind, how can effective design be achieved and good performance maintained? In this talk Andy will lay out guidelines and examples for designing and building effective and attractive web maps (and some other visualizations) around unknown data, identifying compromises, defaults, and clever technologies that get us closer to traditional cartographic perfectionism. Andy will discuss challenges such as: supporting and classifying varied data distributions, handling missing or bad data and errors, working with multiple scales and geographic extents, inspecting work when it's infeasible or impossible to look at the whole map, and finding a balance between the restraints of good design and giving users freedom to explore.
