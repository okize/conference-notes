## Keynote: Better Work Through Better Feedback

### Keavy McMinn

Putting your personal project out into the world often results in nagative outcomes.

We do it because our work really only improves through feedback.

Critical discourse was written into curriculum in art school in order to get students to engage critically with their own work and the work of their peers. To be successful you had to be able to give and receive feedback well.

## Tips on asking for feedback:

* What do you want feedback on? Be explicit about what you're looking for
* When do you want feedback? Be aware of what stage of completion you're at and **be explicit** about this. ie. are you at the early stages of your product? let coworkers know it's half-baked and not suitable to discuss polish; giving and receiving feedback at the wrong stage can be frustrating!
* What indiviuals or type of person to you want feedback from? Seek them out (people like this!)
* Use authentic, but assertive, language when presenting your own work.

## Tips on giving feedback, with empathy:

* Give feedback in a timely manner
* Give it a few minutes before responding, especially if you disagree
* Ask, don't tell
* Criticism vs. critique
	* Citicism tries to shut something down, critique tries to further it
	* Citicism is looking for whats wrong, critique is what's working
	* Citicism looks for flaws in creator, critique is only concerned with what's on the page
* Avoid using derogatory terms, like "stupid"
* Avoid hyperbole.
* Be humble.
* Explain your reasons why something should be changed.
* Offer ways to simplify or improve the work.
* Think how you want the person to **feel**.
* Think about what you want them to **do**.
* Can you use positive language, as opposed to neutral?(which is often perceived as negative)
* Use emoji to clarify written language.
* Practice giving yourself feedback with empathy.

## Tips on receiving feedback:

* Ask for clarification if you don't understand
* Step away from the written word, if there's growing confusion or debate, try to person
* Keep goals of product/project in mind. This isn't about you, it's about the work.
