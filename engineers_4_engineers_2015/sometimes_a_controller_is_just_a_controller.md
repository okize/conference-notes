## Sometimes a Controller is Just a Controller

## No such thing as good code

* The industry doesn't seem to produce better code over time
* Projects rarely succeed or fial based on their code quality
* Snake oil still sells out as fast as Hacker News can stock it

## Fancy code vs. boring code

### Code should...

1. Performs a function
2. Communicates the author's intent

## Communication is subjective

* Teams overcome Fundamental Attribution Error with Empathy

* DRY (don't repeat yourself) == Duplicate nothing
* WET (write everything twice) == Couple nothing

* Your clever code does not impress me
* Your clever code makes me feel stupid
* Ideally, obviousness would impress us

* Memes are ideas competing for our attention via natural selection
* Memes are most valuable when our audience is already familiar with them

## Construction vs. Surgery

* How much time will it take me to build this thing with good code?
  * -> How bad of my Good Code are you willing to accept?
* how much uncertainty and/or risk does this project pose?
  * -> How much uncertaintly will you tolerate?

1. Pick the most uncertain feature
2. Identify risks and unknown
3. Execute spike to reduce uncertaintly
4. Finish feature and move on to next feature

* Relax our conception of what counts as good code
* How we evaluate code is subjective & flawed
* Claiming a right way may push others away
* Seeking opportunities to deliberate kindly and respectfully helps us to think differently
* When someone doesn't understand your code, assume some of the responsibility
