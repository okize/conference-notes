## How To Study Design Patterns

### Colin Williams

---

## Gang of Four book
* allows programmers to think at a higher level of abstraction
* provides a language to foster communications

## criticism of design patterns
* blind application can be harmful
* hard to read
* challenging to understand

* don't think that all you have to do is learn the pattern. that is not studying design patterns
* every decision made in a design pattern is the best choice, so it is important to know the reason
* design patterns are always best on a local scale, but are sometimes the worst in relation to the surrounding code

## How to study

* read a chapter of the book (probably more than once)
* implement an idealized version of the pattern in your language of choice
* review and refactor your implementation with a critical eye
