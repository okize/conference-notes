# The Mobile Content Mandate
### Karen McGrane

20% of americans have no internet access at all
35% have no internet access at home

mobile strategy:
     know your workflow
          it's not a strategy if you can't maintain it
     write better
          there's not such thing as 'how to write for mobile'; there's just good writing
          good content transforms platform
          responsive design won't fix your content problem
     don't create content for a specific context
          you don't get to decide which device people use to access your content. they do.

disruptive technologies eventually get good, or they redefine what good means

do mobile right. right from the start.
