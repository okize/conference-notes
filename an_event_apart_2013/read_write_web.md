# It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web
### Luke Wroblewski

write/read experiences don't work unless people add (write) content to them.

how do we design for mobile creation?

100% consumer -> 10% curator - 1% creator

what we need to do to design is to look at the extremes. The middle will take care of itself.

1. One-handed Use
     don't let the keyboard come up
          do everything in your power not to get the keyboard to come up
2. Be visually engaging
     image rules on mobile
     use images to communicate faster
3. Focused flows
     complex made simple
     more likely to not go far enough instead of too far
4. Just in time actions
     bring in information as it's needed; remove when not
5. Cross device usage
