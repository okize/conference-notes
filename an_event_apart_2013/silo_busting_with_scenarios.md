# Silo-Busting with Scenarios
### Kim Goodwin



best design tool: a scenario

ux purgatory -> space between silos

scenario:
     plausible future story
     stars a persona
     they're trying to use your future product in order to do something (epic)
     we're people, not roles


generative/analytical -> divergent/convergent

scenarios @ multiple levels:
     whole experience
     site functionality
     structure and flow
     page layout
     visual hierarchy

first rule of user research:
     forget about your product
     listen to the person
     at end of conversation bring it to the product

what can you fix??

evangelism takes more then usability

our job is to be delightfulness expertsâ€¦ that's what makes people talk about your product

add something unexpectedly good - how can i exceed their expectations

unexpectedly good - fit & finish

     wwhhd - what would a helpful human do?

make it a story
     stories are sequential (interactions are sequential)
     stories keep the user emotional state front & center

discuss & decide
     what is impossible?
     what is unknown but we should investigate?
     what can be done and how long will it take?

look at your silo informed buy the bigger journey

use scenarios to guide rough storyboards
     what's on the screen
     how it's laid out
     don't stress about widgets and words

polish the details

good experiences only happen when everybody who is part of creating the experience take responsibility for the entire experience
