# Itâ€™s a Great Time To Be a UX Designer
### Jared Spool

Experience Design: The rendering of intent within the gaps.

Specialist: Having more expertise in one area over others.
Generalist: Having equal expertise in most areas.
Compartmentalist: Having expertise in only one area. (a career-limiting decision)
