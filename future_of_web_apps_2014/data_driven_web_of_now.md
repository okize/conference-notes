## The data driven web of now: extending DS3.js

### Travis Smith

__Summary:__
Data on the Web can be represented in a number of ways and is often represented in more than one way at once. Maintaining entire libraries of templates to support growing applications is become harder and harder as a result. In addition, the requirement that data be live is hampered by existing methodologies. We will work through using and extending D3.js to expressively generate representations of data that can be updated live.

templates are simple when data is simple (which is infrequent)
