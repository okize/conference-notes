## Web legos: building mobile applications with Polymer

### Rob Dodson

__Summary:__
What if the web could be fast, beautiful, and responsive by default? Following on from Rey Bango's session at 1:35pm, in this talk we'll take a deeper look at how you can use off-the-shelf Web Components to build an experience that is buttery smooth on phones, desktops and tablets. We'll also show off some cool new tools that make it super easy to go from zero to working prototype in no time flat. Get ready to rethink everything you know about Web design and development.
