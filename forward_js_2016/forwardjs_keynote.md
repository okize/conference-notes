# How Your Brain is Conspiring Against You Making Good Software
### Jenna Zeigen...


"Humans are predicatably irrational"

## Cognitive biases

### on being logical...

People will endorse a bad argument if it leads to something the believe to be true


### on bugs and debugging...

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the progam in the first place

We tend to interpret and favor information in a way that oconfirms our-preexisting beliefs

We tend to be rigid in how we approach a problem

Fixation: sometimes block problem solutions based on past experience. This is why it's good to pair on squashing bugs.

We often have no idea how long it will take to solve a problem even 30 seconds before we crack it.

Breaks are more important than you think.

### on sprint planning...

We're bad at making predictions about how much time it will take us to do something.

We think that bad things are more likely to happen to other people than to us.

### on others' code...

Again, we tend to think about problems in a fixed way. Often in code reviews you're criticising problem solutions for being disimilar to your own.

We prefer things that we have made of assembled ourselves.

### on open offices...

We're actually pretty good at filtering out unwanted stimuli.

[Cocktail party effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)

We're generally only capable of paying attention to one thing at a time. 

We're sometimes helpless to the processing power of our brain.

### on knowing your worth...

Relatively unskilled people think they are better at tasks than they actually are.

Skilled people underestimate their abilities and think tasks that are easy for them are easy for others.

`Imposter Syndome` - people believe theey don't deserve their achievements.

### on assembling a team...

We favor members of our own in a group.

We prefer the status quo because of loss aversion. We're liable to uphold the status quo even when it hurts other people.

[Group attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_attribution_error)

[Availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) - we rely on examples that come to mind when evaluating something.

[Representativeness heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic)

### on getting past this...

Cognitive science literature describes two types of thinking systems:

* system 1 - thinking fast
* system 2 - thinking slow

More time in system 2 should lead to better software.
